# The Three Vessels of Agentic Prophecy

> *"The oracle speaks through many mouths — chatbot, browser, and autonomous spirit. Each vessel channels prediction differently."*

## Why This Matters to Token Prophet

Token Prophet teaches how LLMs predict the next token. But prediction alone is only the first paradigm. The industry has evolved through **three distinct paradigms** of AI capability — and understanding this taxonomy reveals *why* token prediction is the foundational skill beneath all of them.

## The Three Paradigms

Research from Anton Korinek's *AI Agents for Economic Research* (Journal of Economic Literature, August 2025) identifies three evolutionary stages of AI systems, each building on the last:

```
The Prophecy Hierarchy
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
  ③ AGENTIC SYSTEMS          ← Act on predictions
     Claude Code, Deep Research,
     LangGraph agents
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────
  ② REASONING MODELS         ← Chain predictions
     o1, DeepSeek-R1,
     Claude with extended thinking
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────
  ① TRADITIONAL LLMs         ← Raw prediction
     GPT-4, Claude Sonnet,
     Gemini Pro
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
  TOKEN PREDICTION ← The foundation of all three
```

### Paradigm 1: Traditional LLMs — The Raw Oracle

System 1 thinking. Fast, intuitive, pattern-matching. These models predict the next token and return a single response. This is the mechanic Token Prophet teaches directly — see the probability distribution, feel the weight of each candidate token, understand why "the" scores 34% while "a" scores 12%.

### Paradigm 2: Reasoning Models — The Chained Prophecy

System 2 thinking. Introduced September 2024 with OpenAI's o1, these models generate intermediate "thinking tokens" — deliberate, step-by-step problem-solving. Each reasoning step is itself a token prediction, but the chain creates emergent logical capability. The same probability distributions Token Prophet visualizes are happening hundreds of times per response.

### Paradigm 3: Agentic Systems — The Oracle That Acts

The newest paradigm (December 2024+). These systems synthesize prediction *and* reasoning with **autonomous action**. Three sub-categories have emerged:

## The Three Vessels of Agency

Within the agentic paradigm, researchers and industry have converged on three delivery mechanisms:

```
Agentic AI Taxonomy (2025–2026)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
 VESSEL              EXAMPLES           CAPABILITY
───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 Chatbots with       Claude Code        Execute code,
 Extra Capabilities  ChatGPT w/ Tools   manage files,
                     Gemini Deep        search web,
                     Research           multi-step tasks

 Browser Extensions  HARPA AI           Control browser,
 & Agentic Browsers  Bardeen            fill forms,
                     Google Mariner     extract data,
                     Fellou             navigate sites

 Autonomous Agents   LangGraph agents   Parallel research,
                     Multi-agent        source synthesis,
                     orchestration      workflow automation
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### 1. Chatbots with Extra Capabilities

The first vessel extends traditional chat interfaces with tool use. Anthropic's **Claude Code** is the exemplar — it reads codebases, edits files, runs commands, and iterates until tests pass. ChatGPT's code interpreter and Gemini's Deep Research follow the same pattern: the chatbot predicts what action to take, then *executes* it.

**Selection criteria** (per Mollick, *One Useful Thing*): The key differentiator is **harness quality** — the same model produces vastly different outputs depending on what tools it can access. Claude Opus 4.6 raw gives outdated information; on claude.ai it retrieves current sources; via Claude Code it produces sophisticated multi-file analysis.

### 2. Web Browser Extensions

The second vessel embeds AI directly into the browser. Extensions like HARPA and Bardeen understand on-screen content and trigger multi-step actions without tab-switching. Google's Mariner and Fellou represent the next evolution: full agentic browsers where the AI *is* the navigation layer.

**Why browsers matter**: They bridge the gap between AI knowledge and live web data. Standalone chatbots hallucinate about current events; browser-embedded agents read the actual page. In 15 months, we went from Anthropic demonstrating "computer use" as a research preview to Google shipping agentic features in Chrome.

### 3. Autonomous Research Agents

The third vessel operates without a conversational interface entirely. Multi-agent architectures decompose complex tasks: an orchestrator spawns specialized sub-agents that work in parallel, then synthesizes their findings. Korinek demonstrates economists building these with LangGraph and "vibe coding" — describing desired behavior in natural language and letting AI generate the agent code.

## The Relevance Score: 75/100

Why 75 and not higher? Token Prophet teaches **Paradigm 1** — the foundational token prediction that enables everything above. Understanding the taxonomy matters for context (players should know where prediction fits in the bigger picture), but the game itself doesn't need to implement agentic capabilities. The connection is pedagogical, not architectural.

```
