# Changelog

All notable changes to Token Prophet will be documented in this file.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- Applied Roles section in README — tracking Principal Full Stack Developer (Generative AI & Autonomous Agents) application at Extreme Networks via Lever

## [0.3.3] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- The New Glossary research — defines the four pillars (LLMs, RAG, Agents, MCP) with ASCII architecture diagram showing how prediction stacks into action (`docs/new-glossary.md`)
- The Modern Toolbelt research — maps the builder spectrum from foundation models (Claude, Gemini) to AI platforms (Cursor, Lovable, Replit, Bolt) with control-vs-speed positioning (`docs/modern-toolbelt.md`)

## [0.3.2] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- AnythingLLM RAG democratization research — how the 54K-star open-source RAG app validates Token Prophet's probability-shifting pedagogy, with analysis of workspace containerization as prediction boundaries and embedding as oracle translation (`docs/anythingllm-rag-democratization.md`)

## [0.3.1] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- Agentic AI taxonomy research — three paradigms (traditional LLMs → reasoning models → agentic systems) and three delivery vessels (enhanced chatbots, browser extensions, autonomous agents), with relevance scoring to Token Prophet's pedagogical mission (`docs/agentic-ai-taxonomy.md`)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- **Celestial Alignment** — interactive probability manipulation through hypothetical "celestial events"
- 5 toggleable events (Code Star Rising, Security Eclipse, Agent Conjunction, Market Void, Token Flare) that shift Orrery orb weights in real-time
- Orrery now accepts `weightModifiers` prop for dynamic probability visualization
- Astrolabe-inspired glyph UI with gold activation glow and spring animations
- Orb color dynamically shifts between gold/purple based on modified weight threshold
- Smooth 0.8s CSS transitions on orb size, glow, and opacity changes
- Active alignment count readout with AnimatePresence enter/exit
- Full keyboard accessibility (aria-pressed, aria-label on all toggles)
- Navigation: ghost button on landing page, back button on alignment page

## [0.2.4] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- Claude Code compute economics research — $6/day average user cost, $3B losses, rate limit responses, and the venture-subsidized growth paradox (`docs/claude-code-compute-economics.md`)

## [0.2.3] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- Claude Max TOS grey area research — selective enforcement patterns, what it means for AI tooling, and why Token Prophet's zero-API architecture sidesteps it entirely (`docs/claude-max-tos-grey-area.md`)

## [0.2.2] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- Cybersecurity market impact research — how Claude Code Security's launch triggered a sector-wide sell-off and what it means for token prediction (`docs/cybersecurity-stocks-claude-security.md`)

## [0.2.1] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- Claude Code research document — deep dive on the 68K-star agentic coding tool, multi-agent orchestration, and its connection to token prediction (`docs/claude-code-research.md`)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- Algorithmic Orrery — dynamic animated background with orbiting probability orbs
- Central prediction engine with pulsing gold glow
- 8 orbiting data-point orbs across 3 orbital rings, sized and colored by probability weight
- Pure CSS orbital animations (GPU-accelerated transforms)
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` via existing accessibility rules

## [0.1.1] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) research document — deep dive on Anthropic's open standard for AI agent integration (`docs/mcp-research.md`)
- README.md with project overview, tech stack, setup instructions, and structure
- CHANGELOG.md

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- Initial scaffold from Passionate Learning template
- Next.js 16 + React 19 + TypeScript project structure
- Tailwind CSS v4 with oracle/mystical theme colors
- ESLint 9 flat config
- Framer Motion and ts-fsrs dependencies
