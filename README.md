# 🔮 Token Prophet

**See How AI Thinks** — An educational browser game that teaches how LLMs work through token prediction gameplay.

> *Predict the next token. Learn how language models see the world.*

## What Is This?

Token Prophet is a web-based game where you play as an oracle predicting the next token in a sequence — the same fundamental operation that powers every large language model. See probability distributions, learn tokenization, and build intuition for how AI "thinks."

**Part of the [Passionate Learning](https://github.com/DareDev256) game series** — interactive games that teach real ML concepts without requiring any API keys or backend.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 16** + **React 19** + **TypeScript** (strict mode)
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — CSS-first configuration with `@theme inline`
- **Framer Motion** — Animations and transitions
- **ts-fsrs** — Spaced repetition scheduling
- **localStorage** — SSR-safe persistence, no backend required

## Design

Oracle/mystical aesthetic — deep purple (`#9b59b6`) and gold (`#f1c40f`) on black (`#0d0015`). Crystal ball motifs, constellation patterns, probability as divination.
